## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Clone the Repository

2. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akin-shafi/order-chat-project.git
   ```

## Project setup

## Install the required dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
  DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_database_url"
  JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
  PORT=8300
  NODE_ENV=development
```

## Run Migrations

Generate Prisma client and run migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## Start the NestJS application

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## WebSocket Integration

This project uses WebSocket for real-time chat functionalities. Here's how to set up and use WebSockets:

### Start Socket.IO Server

The Socket.IO server is already integrated into the NestJS application. When you start the application, the WebSocket server will automatically initialize.

### Connect to WebSocket Server

Use the following address to connect your client to the WebSocket server:

```bash
const socket = io('http://localhost:8300');

```

## WebSocket Events

# sendMessage: Send a message to a chat room.

```bash
socket.emit('sendMessage', { chatRoomId, senderId, content });

```

```markdown
WebSocket events allow real-time message transfers and room management for better user engagement.

## Order Status

When an order is created, it starts in the **Review** state. The order moves to the **Processing** state after an Admin closes the associated chat. Admins can move an order to the **Completed** state after processing is done.
